       <p>The assignment was to make art by using data structures. I used the program Snap! to create the project. I learnt how to create tools for drawing complex designs from lists of points. What was challenging was using problem decomposition to create the lists of points.</p>

            <p>The assignment was to make modrern art with polygons. I used the program Snap! to create the project. To operate you insert side length and the number of sides to the following tools; pinnywheel, polygon, star, and astericks. I learned how to create custom blocks on Snap! and the challenge was the math requiredwithin the custom blocks.</p>

              <p>The assignment was to creat a drawing app for the congressional app challenge. I used the program Snap! to create the project. To operate the drawing app, first you press "d" to exit the loading screen. Next, you would click the draw shape or draw polygon tools to create a shape. You can use shape to draw. I learnt how to find the center of a regular polygon and I had a challenge with the math to find the center of a regular polygon.</p>
